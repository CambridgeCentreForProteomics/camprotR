\title{Estimate SILAC (2-plex) incorporation rate from PD output}
\usage{
estimate_incorporation(
  psm_infile,
  peptide_infile,
  crap_fasta,
  master_protein_col = "Master.Protein.Accessions",
  protein_col = "Protein.Accessions",
  sequence_col = "Sequence",

\arguments{
\item{psm_infile}{\code{string}. Filepath to PSM-level PD output}

\item{peptide_infile}{\code{string}. Filepath to peptide-level PD output}

\item{crap_fasta}{\code{string}. Filepath to cRAP fasta used for PD search}

\item{master_protein_col}{\code{string}. Name of column containing master
protein accessions.}

\item{protein_col}{\code{string}. Name of column containing all protein
accessions.}

\item{sequence_col}{\code{string}. Name of column containing peptide sequences.}

\item{modifications_col}{\code{string}. Name of column containing peptide modifications.}

\item{mix}{\code{numeric}. If Light material has been spiked in,
what is the abundance relative to the Heavy material? Default is \code{mix = 0}
e.g. no Light spike in. If they are equal, \code{mix = 1}.}

\item{outdir}{\code{NULL} or \code{string}. If not \code{NULL}, filepath for directory to
save the plots and summary table.}
}
\value{
By default returns a \code{list} with 3 ggplots (HL correlation, peptide-level
incorporation, protein-level incorporation) and 1 summary table. If \code{outdir}
is not \code{NULL} then the plots and table will be saved into \code{outdir}.
}
\description{
SILAC (2-plex) incorporation can be estimated using the PSM and
peptide groups PD outputs, and summarised at the peptide or protein level.

This function takes the PSM.txt and PeptideGroups.txt files as inputs and
outputs 3 plots and a .tsv file into the designated output directory.
}
\details{
\strong{Peptide sequencing/mass shift identification}
In SILAC, the peptide identity of ions can be established through MS2
fragmentation ('peptide sequencing') or by mass shift (within tolerance
limits) relative to a sequenced peptide.

For 2-plex SILAC experiments, ideally, the correlation between Heavy and
Light peptide intensities is the same regardless of whether Light or Heavy
peptides are identified by mass shift or sequencing. If e.g Light peptide
intensities are not well correlated when they are identified by mass shift,
this may indicate that the mass shift identifications are erroneously
picking up ghost peptides', which will make incorporation estimation difficult.

\strong{Mixing Heavy and Light material for incorporation rate testing}
To get around the issue of 'ghost peptides', one can spike in
Light material (at cell or protein extract-level) to the Heavy material
being analysed.

\title{Filter rows based on the sum of values in column groups}
\usage{
filter_val(data, op, setop, regex, value)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{data.frame} or \code{matrix} to be filtered.}

\item{op}{\code{string}. Defines the operation used for the filtering. Should be
one of \code{"=="}, \code{"<="}, \code{">="}, or \code{"!="}.}

\item{setop}{The function used for combining the results for the different
column groups. Should be one of \code{union} (equivalent to "OR"), \code{intersect}
(equivalent to "AND"), or \code{setdiff} (equivalent to "SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE").}

\item{regex}{\verb{character vector} of length n. The regular expression(s) used
to define the column groups. The length of the vector indicates the number
of column groups to use.}

\item{value}{\verb{numeric vector} of length n. The number of summed values to
check for in the rows of each column group. Must be the same length as the
\code{regex} vector.}
}
\value{
Returns a filtered object of the same class as \code{data}.
}
\description{
This function is used to filter rows based on the sum of
values in different groups of columns. The column groups are defined by a
regex matching their names. This provides more granular control over what
is filtered out compared to filtering based on ratios alone.

The function can be explained as follows:\preformatted{filter_val(
  data,
  op = "<=",
  setop = intersect,
  regex = c("sample_A", "sample_B"),
  value = c(100, 50)
)
}

The above can be translated as: keep rows that add up to less than or equal
to 100 in the "sample_A" columns AND less than or equal to 50 in the
"sample_B" columns.

More illustrative examples are below.
